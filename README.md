# WaterUp - Project Website
![PHP version](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP%20versiom->=7.0-brightgreen.svg)<br/>
We are developing an internet of things device as part of the project
innovate at Stenden University of applied sciences. In this project
we are free to develop an product based on the internet of things.
We chose to create an plant pot with an mobile application that is
capable of taking care that its hosting.

The plant pot holds an water reservoir and multiple sensors for
controlling the amount of water the plant should receive. Because every
plant is difrent it needs to adjust the configuration based on the plant
species.

The mobile app is used to notify users about the state of the pot and
send warnings when something is wrong like if the water reservoir is
almost empty or if the plant is receiving to much sun light. The app
will also be used to configure the right plant species by taking an
picture of the plant, and let machine learning classify the species.
